# Solar PV tool

The PV-Generation tool can be used to model the potential solar generation ability of a site. The tool uses solar panel, weather and location data to estimate the potential energy generation of a commercial site. There is a `Demo_notebook.ipynb` that users can run to get a basic understanding of how the tool works and see various functionalities.

Data is provided in the `data` folder with both example site energy consumption data, weather data examples from the weather tool and capital cost data to do with the solar pv panels.
